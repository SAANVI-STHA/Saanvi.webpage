    <H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
   Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands.
    East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a
     few smaller offshore islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan
      to the southeast. The provincial capital, Denpas is the most populous city in the 
      Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia.
       Denpasar metropolitan area is the extended metropolitan area around Denpasar.
        The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar isconsidered Bali's cultural centre.
         The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise 
         in tourism since the 1980s, and becoming an Indonesian area of overtourism. 
         Tourism-related business makes up 80% of the Bali economy.

         <H1>HISTORY</H1>
         Bali was inhabited around 2000 BC by Austronesian people who migrated originally
          from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia.
          Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the
           Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Oceania. Stone tools
            dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.

            In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, the Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava,
             Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal 
             Godhead.

              <H1>WHY IS BALI FAMOUS?</H1>
              As Indonesia’s most visited island, Bali is known for many enchanting aspects. Famed the world 
              over for its gorgeous tiered rice terraces, signature soft white sands, and timeless water 
              temples, Bali has no shortage of iconic landmarks and photogenic panoramas.Still, what truly
               stands out about the Island of the Gods, as Bali is affectionately known, is its distinctive
                cultural traditions and religious celebrations. As Indonesia’s only predominantly Hindu island,
                 Bali’s thousands of temples and unique ceremonial practices have ensured that this single island—one
                  of some 17,000 across Indonesia’s archipelago—is globally revered. Slow-burning incense sticks,
                   infused with delicate floral fragrances, are seen and smelled everywherePlaced in small trays 
                   fashioned from pandan or palm leaves, the incense sticks are one of the many components that form 
                   canang sari, pretty and painstakingly put together daily offerings to the gods.Impressive both for
                    their localized architecture and the sheer number of sacred spaces, Balinese Hindu Temples, locally
                     known as Puras, coat the cultural landscape of this beautiful island. Estimates place the number of
                      temples and shrines in the five figures, with every household also having its own private place of
                       prayer.Many of Bali’s most famous temples are part of vast religious complexes dating back centuries.
                        The millennia-old Batuan Temple and the cliff-carved Gunung Kawi, with its double-digit shrines, are 
                        two of the island’s most unmissable sites.For over 1,000 years, these cultivated areas have been an 
                        integral part of the island’s agricultural scene. Still irrigated by the subak water management system
                         until this day, the ingenious combination of canals, small dams, and tunnels remains an exceptional
                          part of Bali’s landscape.Bali is also famous for fragnent flavors,idyllic beaches,Ubud Palace,The Sacred
                           Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Traditional dance,dramatic volcanoes ETC...
